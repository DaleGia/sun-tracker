This is an Atmega32 x/y axis sun tracking unit written in assembler. It was written for a second year group assignment as apart of RMITs Introduction to Embedded Systems course. While the assignment was a group assignment, the code contained was written solely by myself, Dale Giancono. The purpose of the assignment was to help students to become more familier with the various peripherals available with Atmel AVR Microcontrollers, as well as helping students understand assembler code.

The project itself was implemented using VMLAB, however only the asm code is contained in this repositary.

For a more detailed outlook on the project, please refer to the final report.
